Localization is crucial for \acrfull{uavs} when conducting \acrfull{slam} with a pre-existing map. In this context, the use of RGB-D cameras emerges as a potent technique, offering significant advantages in addressing the complexities of \arcshort{slam} challenges. This research introduces a framework that exploits the detailed information available in RGB imagery for 2D instance segmentation. By integrating this segmentation with point cloud data derived from depth information, we can effectively isolate and analyze key segment points. This enables segment-based mapping and localization that utilizes both color and depth information. Our methodology demonstrates that leveraging RGB-D data in localization tasks within a prior semantic map not only accelerates the real-time processing of point clouds and local maps but also enhances the accuracy of landmark matching through improved descriptors.
